## About me
I'm responsible, hardworking, conscientious, purposeful, tactful, have willingness to learn something new and improve myself.

7 years worked as a math teacher at school. In 2019 I decided to change scope of work.
I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React in online courses and independently from open sources on the Internet. I really liked this direction and would like to grow and evolve in it.
Continue to study and improve my skills. Want to become really good professional.

## Skills
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Figma, MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), React, Photoshop.

## Code example
```
const emailInput = document.querySelector('#email');
emailInput.addEventListener('blur', function(event) {
  const email = event.target.value;
  if (email) {
    const regexp = /(\w+\.)+\w+/g;
    const condition = !email.match(regexp);
    validationBorder(event, condition);
  }
});
```
